            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Passionate about technology, I enjoy seeking out elegant solutions to technical problems. From making
                games
                in Unity to building machine learning models in Python, I am always tech-focused inside and out of the
                classroom and workspace. That passion for technology drives me to continuously seek out new technologies
                to
                learn and to explore the depths of the ones I already use.
            </p>
            <p>
                In May 2020, I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a B.S. in Arts and Entertainment
                Technologies. After finding a passion for working with data, I decided to pursue my M.S. in Information
                Technology and Management at UT Austin, where I am learning how to form technical solutions to business
                problems. I am due to graduate May 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of the classroom, some of my hobbies include playing strategy board games, playing and building
                video games, running, and hiking.

                    At H-E-B, I worked on the Data Engineering team to create a microservice REST API in Python to help
                    support data pipeline workflows. The tech stack I used included a Python client library and backend
                    API,
                    a React frontend, and a Postgres database.
