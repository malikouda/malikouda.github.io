            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Passionate about technology, I enjoy seeking out elegant solutions to technical problems. From making games in Unity to building machine learning models in Python, I am always tech-focused inside and out of the classroom and workspace. That passion for technology drives me to continuously seek out new technologies to learn and to explore the depths of the ones I already use. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In May 2020, I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a B.S. in Arts and Entertainment Technologies. After finding a passion for working with data, I decided to pursue my M.S. in Information Technology and Management at UT Austin, where I am learning how to form technical solutions to business problems. I am due to graduate May 2021.

            <p>
                Outside of the classroom, some of my hobbies include playing strategy board games, playing and building video games, running, and hiking.

                    At H-E-B, I worked on the Data Engineering team to create a microservice REST API in Python to help support data pipeline workflows. The tech stack I used included a Python client library and backend API, a React frontend, and a Postgres database.
